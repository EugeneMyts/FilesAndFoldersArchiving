File/Folder Archiving

This project allows users to archive their files and folders, creating a compressed file that contains the selected files and folders. Archiving files and folders helps to organize and store them efficiently, reducing file size and facilitating easier sharing and storage. This project provides a simple Java code snippet for archiving files and folders.

Usage

To use the file/folder archiving code, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/EugeneMyts/FilesAndFoldersArchiving.git

2.Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

3.Locate the Main.java file in the project.

4.Modify the path, in, and out variables in the main method to specify the desired source folder path and the output archive file path.

String path = "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\";

String in = path + "folder";

String out = path + "archive.zip";

5.Ensure that the in variable points to the folder you want to archive and that the out variable specifies the desired output archive file path.

6.Build and run the project. The code will generate an archive file (archive.zip) containing the contents of the specified folder.
